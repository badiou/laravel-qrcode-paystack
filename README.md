Laravel Paystack Payment Project
Introduction
This application is an application that allows you to create QR codes of items and to make an online payment for these items using the paystack payment method (https://www.paystack.com).
To set up this application, I use infyomlabs / laravel-generator to generate the CRUD from the tables generated in the database:
To access the documentation of InfyOm, please go to the following link: https://labs.infyom.com/laravelgenerator/docs/5.6/installation.

As part of payment with Paystack (a payment method from Nigeria to Naira), my application uses the git deposit: https://github.com/unicodeveloper/laravel-paystack.git
